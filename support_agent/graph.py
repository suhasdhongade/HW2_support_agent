"""The flow: what runs, in what order. Lectures 7 and 8.

WHAT WE SHIP is a straight line, and it is not an agent:

    (start) --> lookup --> retrieve --> respond --> (end)

`lookup` is a regular expression that spots an order number. It cannot decide
anything, cannot call a second tool after seeing what the first one returned, and
cannot do anything on the customer's behalf.

WHAT YOU BUILD is a flow with branches and a loop:

                          +---------------------------+
                          v                           |   TODO 4: the loop
    (start) --> triage ---+--> retrieve --> act -------+
                  |                          |
                  |                          v
                  |                       verify          TODO 3: is it supported?
                  |                          |
                  +--> clarify               +--> respond --> (end)
                  |    (ask one question)    |
                  +--> escalate -------------+  (hand to a human)

    triage    work out what kind of message this is and which way to go
    act       the loop from Lecture 7: ask the model what to do, run the tool it
              asked for, hand back the result, ask again
    verify    check the draft answer is actually supported by the handbook text
    escalate  write the handover note for the human

The rules the agent needs — return windows, refund limits, when to fetch a human —
are already written in `policy.py`. You are building the thing that uses them.

        #      Replace the fixed edges with `add_conditional_edges(node, fn, {...})`,
        #      where `fn` looks at the state and returns the name of the next step.
        #      That one change is what turns a pipeline into an agent. You need a
        #      branch after `act` (did the model ask for another tool, or is it
        #      done?) and one after `triage` (answer it, ask a question, or fetch
        #      a human?).
        #
        #   b) STATE. Look at state.py. Fields marked with `operator.add` grow;
        #      everything else gets overwritten. Every field you add is a choice
        #      between those two, and choosing wrong quietly loses information on
        #      each loop.

        #   c) MEMORY AND A HUMAN CHECKPOINT. Two arguments to `compile()` below:
        #        checkpointer=MemorySaver()   saves the state after each step, so a
        #                                     second message in the same conversation
        #                                     can see what happened in the first
